I'm afraid I don't know how to apply that operation to that
combination of types. Continue, and I'll return the second
argument (see above) as the result of the operation.

Oh dear. I can't decide if the expression above is positive,
negative, or zero. So this comparison test won't be `true'.

Oh dear. I can't decide if the expression above is positive,
negative, or zero. So this comparison test won't be `true'.

! Missing `=' has been inserted.

                   #
l.4 #
     include <ctime>
The next thing in this loop should have been `=' or `:='.
But don't worry; I'll pretend that an equals sign
was present, and I'll look for the values next.

combination of types. Continue, and I'll return the second
argument (see above) as the result of the operation.

l.6 using namespace std;
                        
The next thing in this loop should have been a `:'.
So I'll pretend that a colon was present;
everything from here to `endfor' will be iterated.

! Enormous number has been reduced.
l.11   for(counter = 1000; counter < 10000
                                          ; counter++)
I can't handle numbers bigger than about 4095.99998;
so I've changed your constant to that maximum amount.
